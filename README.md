# crud_spring
This is my first CRUD made in JAVA where I used the Spring framework in order to create an API-REST. Also I used Postman in order to test the backend functionality.


In this screenshot, I am making a request to create a record through the postman program with the JSON format. This is where I am consuming my first API-REST.

The user's data is stored into a database hosted on a phpmyadmin server

This is where I am able to read all the data using resources identified by an URI.

And finally, this is where I am able to delete records from the database.
